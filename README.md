# Nat's GC Boss Mods
A number of mods changing bosses in Gravity Circuit, packaged together for easy distribution.
To install the mods, simply place the "lua" folder within %appdata%/Gravity Circuit. To "uninstall" the mods, remove the folder from said directory.
At the moment, Wrecker Tank, Trace, Cable, Blade, Bit, Crash, Medley, Nega, Circuit Crystal, and Kernel are changed.
