# Nat-s-GC-Boss-Mods
A number of mods adding or changing bosses in Gravity Circuit, packaged together for easy distribution.
To install the mod(s), simply place the "lua" folder, contained inside the zip, within %appdata%/Gravity Circuit. To "uninstall" the mod(s), remove the folder from said directory.
At the moment, Wrecker Tank, Cable, Crash, Nega and Circuit Crystal are changed.
