# Nat's GC Boss Mods
A number of mods for adding or changing bosses in Gravity Circuit, packaged together for easy distribution.
To install the mod(s), simply place the folders contained inside the folder for the mod/modpack you want to use within %appdata%/Gravity Circuit. To "uninstall" the mod(s), remove the folder from said directory.
At the moment, Wrecker Tank, Cable, Crash, Medley, Nega, Circuit Crystal, and Kernel are changed.
